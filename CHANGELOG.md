# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [v0.3.3] - 2026-08-28

### Security

- **Headless API Requires Authentication to Bind a Public Address**: The headless web server defaulted to `0.0.0.0:8080` and its auth middleware passed every request through when no credentials were configured, so the shipped `docker-compose.yml` published an entirely unauthenticated API — including `/api/invoke` (the command bridge, which can save and execute script alert actions), `/api/stream` (reads any file the process can read) and `/api/upload`. Startup now refuses a non-loopback bind without `--user`/`--pass`, and points at the loopback and reverse-proxy alternatives. `--insecure-no-auth` / `RCLONE_MANAGER_INSECURE_NO_AUTH=true` restores the previous behaviour for deployments that authenticate in front of the app. A warning is logged whenever the server runs without authentication.
- **Send-to Menu Entries No Longer Execute Remote Path Names**: The generated Nautilus script, KDE service menu and Nemo action interpolated the remote name and path into a double-quoted shell word, where `$(…)` and backticks still expand. A remote folder named e.g. `Photos$(…)` ran as code the next time the file-manager menu entry was used. The same values are also escaped for the Automator workflow on macOS, where XML escaping alone did not stop the shell.
- **Path Traversal in Headless Batch Upload**: `/api/upload` joined the multipart `filename` onto the staging directory unsanitized. `Path::join` with an absolute path replaces the base, so a crafted `Content-Disposition` could write anywhere the process could — over the rclone binary, for instance. Filenames are now reduced to plain relative components; folder uploads keep their interior directories.
- **Config Files Are Owner-Readable Only**: `settings.json` and `store.json` hold the rclone config password, extra-backend passwords, SMTP credentials and bot tokens, and were written 0644 under the usual umask. They are now written 0600.
- **Session Tokens Expire Server-Side**: Headless session cookies carried a `Max-Age`, but the server never forgot the token, so a captured session stayed valid until the process restarted. Sessions are now stamped and expired on use, capped in number, and marked `Secure` when serving TLS. Basic credentials are compared in constant time.

### Fixed

- **Split View Operated on the Wrong Pane**: Delete, Rename, multi-Rename, "New folder with selection" and Archive resolved the selected names against the primary pane even when the selection belonged to the secondary one. With both panes showing files of the same name — the usual reason to open split view — deleting a file on the right deleted its namesake on the left. Dragging from the primary pane also no longer picks up the secondary pane's selection.
- **Nautilus File-Manager Extension Never Loaded**: The generated `nautilus-python` `MenuProvider` was not valid Python — the already-quoted executable path produced `exec_path = ""/opt/app""` — so GNOME Files silently skipped it and the advertised Files context-menu entry never appeared.
- **Multi-Rename Crashed on Non-ASCII File Names**: Case-insensitive find/replace indexed the original name with an offset taken from its lowercased copy. `to_lowercase()` is not length-preserving, so renaming files such as `İstanbul` aborted the application.
- **Crash When Picking a Config File in Repair**: Selecting a config file through Repair → "restore or pick config" panicked on a re-entrant `RefCell` borrow.
- **Check Results Panel Was Always Empty**: Check and cryptcheck results read `core/stats.checks`, which is rclone's counter of completed checks rather than a list of rows, and the result list was silently discarded.
- **Local Folders Containing `:` Were Unreachable**: Path parsing split on the first colon before recognising an absolute path, so browsing to `/home/you/2024:notes` navigated to a nonexistent remote.
- **Config Could Be Lost on a Crash or Serialization Error**: `settings.json` and `store.json` were written non-atomically, and a serialization failure wrote an empty file. A truncated file is silently replaced by defaults on the next launch, losing every remote, quick run and alert rule. Both are now serialized first, written to a temp file, fsynced and renamed into place.
- **Webhook "Verify TLS" Switch Did Nothing**: The alert action editor stored `tls_verify` but the dispatcher never read it, so a webhook on an internal host with a self-signed certificate could not be reached.
- **Headless Single-File Uploads Leaked Their Temporary Copy**: Cleanup called `remove_dir_all` on a regular file, which fails with `ENOTDIR`, so every upload left a full copy in the temp directory.
- **Labels Containing `&` or `<` Rendered Blank**: Row and group titles are parsed as Pango markup, and a title that fails to parse draws nothing at all — so a file named `Tom & Jerry.mp4` silently vanished from the file browser, and shipped labels such as "Alerts & Notifications", "Jobs & File Operations", "Warnings & Errors" and "Save & Restart" rendered as empty text.
- **Two Broken Icons**: "Copy to…" and the Logs empty state referenced icon names that do not exist in the Adwaita theme and drew the broken-image placeholder.
- **Empty Folders Showed a Blank Pane**: The file browser now shows a proper empty state, with a separate one for an empty Starred view.
- **Cut Files and Column Headers Were Dimmed Twice**: Cut rows landed at 25% opacity instead of 50%, and list-view column headers were barely legible.
- **Split-View Delete and Rename Acted on the Wrong Pane**: See above; also affected "New folder with selection", Archive, and dragging out of the primary pane.
- **Crashes on Tab Switch, Unstar, Banner Dismiss and Config Navigation**: Six `RefCell` borrows were held across calls that re-borrow the same cell. Switching file-browser tabs panicked every time.
- **`serve` Automations Panicked the Scheduler**: A firing serve automation took down the automation task, and with it every other automation.
- **Multi-Rename and the Log Parser Crashed on Non-ASCII Text**; a crafted or corrupt media file could overflow the stack.
- **Durations in `µs` Were Rejected**: The validator advanced two bytes past a three-byte character.

### Changed

- **Faster Polling and Fewer Round Trips**: Every rclone RC call built a fresh HTTP agent, so no TCP connection was ever reused; job polling issued a blocking `core/stats` per job inside each tick; a detached Files window ran an ungated 400 ms poll; cron expressions were re-parsed on every tick; and the Logs dialog read the whole of the never-rotated `rclone.log` every two seconds. `df` calls are now bounded, so a hung FUSE mount no longer freezes the app.
- **Correct Minimum Rust Version**: `gtk-app` declared 1.80 but uses `Option::is_none_or`, stable since 1.82. CI now lints all targets rather than only the library, which holds under half of the client.
- **Backend Test Suite Builds and Runs on Every Target**: `cargo test --features web-server --no-default-features` did not compile, and 35 doctests failed on every target because rclone's help text — copied verbatim into doc comments by `npm run sync:endpoints` — contains indented shell and JSON samples that rustdoc compiles as Rust. The generator now emits them as `text` blocks.
- **Attribution**: Added [ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md](ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.md) and an Acknowledgements section in every README crediting rclone (Nick Craig-Wood and contributors), upstream RClone Manager (Hakan İSMAİL and the Zarestia Dev team), the GNOME Project's GTK 4 and libadwaita, Tauri, and every direct dependency with its license. About → Credits in the app was rebuilt into linked, grouped acknowledgements.
- **Documentation**: Added `LINTING.md` and `ISSUES.md`, which every README and `CONTRIBUTING.md` already linked to but which did not exist.

## [v0.3.2] - 2026-08-24

### Added
- **Flow Overlay & Automation Hub**: Added a dedicated Flow overlay system accessible from the sidebar navigation for streamlined automation, Quick Run execution, and template management. Workflow editor is planned to be added in a future release.
- **Quick Run Execution & Management System**:
  - **One-Click Operation Execution**: Launch predefined or custom Rclone operations (Sync, Copy, Move, Mount, Serve, Bisync, Check, etc.) with a single click.
  - **Real-Time Job Tracking & State Reflection**: Live progress indicators, execution status, and dynamic state updates on Quick Run cards with instant stop/cancellation controls.
  - **Comprehensive Quick Run Editor**: Easily configure source/destination paths, operation parameters, advanced Rclone flags, and execution preferences.
  - **CLI Command Import**: Import full CLI command strings (e.g. `rclone copy /src /dst --dry-run --bwlimit 10M`) directly into Quick Run configs and Remote configurations with automatic flag parsing and mapping.
  - **Card Organization & Tagging**: Organize, tag, search, reorder, duplicate, and manage Quick Runs across custom categories.
- **Modular Dashboard Overview Panels & Layout Management**: Refactored the dashboard overview into customizable modular panels (System Overview, Disk Usage, Remotes, Mounts, Serves, Operations) with sticky headers and centralized layout customization controls (drag-and-drop ordering and visibility toggles) directly in the header toolbar.
- **Dedicated Remote Deletion Confirmation Modal**: Added a safety-first confirmation dialog for deleting remotes with clear warnings and dependency awareness.
- **System Sleep/Shutdown Intercept**: Added OS-level power inhibitor integration on Linux (systemd logind), Windows (ShutdownBlockReasonCreate), and macOS (IOPMAssertionCreateWithName). The application now prevents the system from sleeping or shutting down while active file transfer operations are in progress.
- **Android Storage Access Framework (SAF) Integration**: Added comprehensive Storage Access Framework (SAF) support for Android devices. #273
  - **SAF Remote & Tree Picker**: Allows selecting and authorizing local directories, SD cards, and USB OTG drives via native Android SAF tree picker intents (`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`).
  - **Android DocumentsProvider**: Added `RcloneDocumentsProvider` to expose mounted Rclone remotes to external Android apps and system file pickers.
  - **SAF VFS Mount Bridge**: Integrated a SAF VFS mount bridge enabling in-process virtual filesystem access for Android storage providers.
  - **Android Background Keep-Alive & Boot Receiver**: Added `RcloneKeepAliveService` for persistent background mounts and `ResumeUploadsBootReceiver` for boot initialization on Android.
- **Template Management**: Added support for managing and using templates. Added in Quick run editor and Remote Config Modal. Releated #260.
- **Subdirectory-Scoped Real-time Monitoring & File Watcher**: Added an option to synchronize only modified subdirectories instead of scanning the full root tree when triggered by real-time file monitoring events.
  - **Scoped Sync Targets**: Computes scoped source and destination targets from detected filesystem changes and dispatches targeted batch operations.
- **Monochrome & Theme-Aware System Tray Icon Management**: Added configurable tray icon theme options (Color, System Auto Monochrome, Monochrome Light, Monochrome Dark) in Preferences -> General. Automatically adapts tray icons to desktop dark/light themes with real-time reactive updates. Closes #286.

### Changed
- **CLI Import & Flag Mapping Optimization**: Optimized the CLI command parser and import workflow across Quick Run Editor and Remote Config modals. Enhanced tokenizer with intelligent hyphenated argument recognition (e.g. `--suffix -bak`, `--min-age -1d`), multi-operation flag resolution (preserving shared copy/sync flags such as `--backup-dir`, `--track-renames`, `--checksum`), inline bash comment stripping, unified path parsing, and zero-allocation key normalizations in the backend.
- **Backend Command Bridge & Error Handling**: Migrated backend Tauri command invocations to a standardized bridge macro system with centralized error mapping and structured localization payloads.
- **Non-Blocking CLI Flags & Automatic Flat Option Mapping**: Updated JSON editor to treat CLI-style arguments (e.g. `--value-of-rclone`, `--bwlimit`) as non-blocking warnings instead of hard validation errors. The backend payload builder now automatically normalizes CLI flags into snake_case flat options (`value_of_rclone`, `bwlimit`) across all Quick Runs, Profiles, and operations.
- **Native Rclone OAuth Endpoint Integration**: Dropped external Rclone OAuth authorization management in favor of native Rclone OAuth endpoint support (`rclone v1.75+`). Also supports remote Rclone instances.
- **Minimum Supported Rclone Version**: Updated minimum supported Rclone version to `1.75.0`.

### Removed
- **Legacy Migrations & Legacy Config Support**: Removed legacy keyring credentials migration, legacy 7z/zip 1.0.0 backup format restore, legacy config conversion maps, legacy settings flattening migrators, legacy UI warning banners, and the `sevenz-rust2` crate dependency. Standard `.rcman` backup restore and preview remain fully supported.

### Fixed
- **File Browser Freeze & Missing Drives on Wakeup / Stale Mounts**: Fixed an issue where encountering hung or unresponsive drives (e.g. stale WinFsp mounts, disconnected network shares, sleeping HDDs on Windows) or waking up from sleep/systray caused the File Browser sidebar and sync settings drive selectors to freeze and drop both local and cloud remote lists. Disk enumeration in the Rust backend is now non-blocking with timeout protection and graceful root fallback, while frontend remote loading operates independently via `Promise.allSettled`. Fixes #263
- **Job Stats Group Retention on Finish / Stop**: Fixed an issue where stopping or completing an operation immediately deleted the accounting stats group in rclone memory, causing UI check results, transfer metrics, and error summaries to disappear prematurely. Stats groups are now preserved in rclone memory while the job remains in the job list and are only deleted when the job is actually deleted from the cache, with new operations pre-clearing their group stats before execution. Fixes #211
- **Docker Entrypoint Privilege Dropping & Supplementary Groups (`PGIDS`)**: Fixed permission denied errors (`EACCES`) when accessing ZFS datasets or directories formatted with NFSv4 ACLs in Docker by replacing `gosu` with `setpriv` in `entrypoint.sh`. Added support for the `PGIDS` environment variable to propagate supplementary group IDs to the daemon process. Fixes #282
- Fix dynamic reloading of remotes list on rclone configuration and backend settings changes.
- **Reactive System Theme Updates**: Fixed system theme detection and state synchronization by eliminating blocking CLI subprocess checks in favor of WebKit's native `matchMedia` color-scheme event listeners.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- **Android Beta Release (APKs for arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, x86_64, x86)**: Introduced Android Beta support with architecture-separated APK builds (`arm64-v8a`, `armeabi-v7a`, `x86_64`, `x86`). Powered by an in-process Go engine (`librclone`) via FFI bindings. Tested on Samsung Galaxy S23 FE. iOS status is currently unverified due to lack of testing devices. For more details, see the [Android Documentation](https://hakanismail.info/zarestia/rclone-manager/docs/configuration-android).
- **Nautilus Sidebar Drives & Remotes Customization**: Added the ability to reorder and hide/show local disks and cloud remotes in the Nautilus sidebar via a dedicated sidebar configuration modal. #233
- **Nautilus Context Menu System Clipboard Integration**: Added support for pasting OS system clipboard file paths and URIs directly from the right-click context menu, with automatic paste button visibility based on clipboard contents.
- **New Russian Translations**: Added support for Russian language and translations. Thanks to @korsun009! PR #266
- **New Brazilian Portuguese Translations**: Added support for Brazilian Portuguese language and translations. Thanks to @eduardomozart! PR #269
- **New Japanese Translations**: Added support for Japanese language and translations. Thanks to @fuannanyo! PR #270
- **Nautilus File Viewer Open in System Default Viewer**: Added the ability to open files in the system default viewer. First download if its remote file.

### Changed
- **Change the mattoltip to title attribute**: Changed the mattooltip to title attribute for better performance and visuals.
- **Nautilus Detached Dialogs & Multi-Tasking Integration**: Wired Nautilus file browser window creation to the `general.standalone_dialogs` ("Detached Dialogs") setting. Opening a remote or path now displays as an in-app modal overlay when detached dialogs are disabled, while spawning standalone OS windows when enabled. Added a dedicated "Open in New Window" (pop-out) action to the overlay toolbar for seamless multitasking.
- **Generalized Item Order & Visibility Modal**: Renamed and refactored `ActionSelectionModalComponent` into a generic `ItemOrderVisibilityModalComponent` supporting both starred quick action button configuration and item visibility/ordering management across the application.
- **Universal Interactive Remote Configuration**: Enhanced `interactive-config-step` and the remote creation orchestrator to generically support all rclone interactive configuration steps across any remote type (OneDrive, Google Drive, SFTP, Box, S3, Crypt, Mega, etc.). #243
- UI improvements. #251 #252 #253 
- **Remote Disk Usage Loader Optimization**: Optimized remote disk usage checking by eliminating redundant pre-flight `getFeatures()` RPC requests. Disk usage (`rclone about`) is now requested directly, dynamically mapping unsupported responses (such as `"doesn't support about"`) directly to the unsupported state in the UI. #259
- **Uploaded files preserve the dates**: When uploading files to remote storages, the original file modification dates are now preserved. Only for local Rclone instances. #268
- **Rclone Providers**: Remove the uptobox translation. 

### Fixed
- **Remote Connection Payload Unmarshaling with Runtime Overrides**: Fixed an issue where operations (Mount, Sync, Copy, Serve, etc.) using boolean or numeric runtime remote overrides (e.g., `onedrive.av_override: true`) failed with a Go unmarshal error (`key "fs": Reshape failed to Unmarshal: json: cannot unmarshal bool into Go value of type string`). Boolean and numeric values in the `fs` connection payload are now automatically stringified before being sent to rclone. #265
- **Multi-Select Remote Configuration Options**: Fixed an issue where non-exclusive string options with predefined example lists (such as the `Scope` setting in Google Drive) were rendered as single-select dropdowns, preventing users from selecting multiple items. #262
- **Rclone Auth Error Detection**: Fixed an HTTP status code formatting bug where formatting the `StatusCode` display string (e.g., `"401 Unauthorized"`) prevented parsing the status code numerically in the error classifier. This resulted in auth failures (HTTP 401) being misclassified as generic startup/connection failures, preventing the engine from triggering the Auth Required repair sheet in the UI. #256
- **Linux Window Resize Handles**: Added custom HTML/CSS resize handle borders in the frontend shell layout to restore cursor and drag-to-resize functionality on undecorated Linux windows. #236
- **Remote Configuration Flags Loading**: Fixed a bug where flag configs sometimes failed to load and cached failed/empty results in the `MemoizedLoader` until a UI reload. Also resolved a race condition during modal initialization by sequencing metadata and dependent flag fields loading. #264
- **Detached Modal Backend Synchronization**: Fixed an issue where switching active backends (e.g., between Local and Remote) did not update path opening and file picker handlers in detached modal windows, causing system file manager or internal Nautilus actions to target the wrong backend until a UI reload.

## [v0.3.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Bot-less Telegram & WhatsApp Alerts**: Added support for bot-less Telegram notifications (via CallMeBot API) and a dedicated WhatsApp alert action channel to the Alert & Notification system.
  - **Telegram Bot-less Mode**: Allows sending Telegram alerts directly to your Telegram `@username` without needing to create a bot token via `@BotFather`.
  - **WhatsApp Notification Channel**: Added a new `whatsapp` alert action type supporting CallMeBot (`https://api.callmebot.com/whatsapp.php`) for personal WhatsApp push notifications, as well as custom HTTP gateway URLs.

### Fixed
- Linux zbus panics across the app.
- **Encryption Detection in Non-Librclone Mode**: Resolved an issue where non-librclone mode failed to correctly detect when an Rclone configuration file was encrypted.
- **Task State & Status Refreshing**: Fixed an issue where active tasks, automated file watchers, and scheduled jobs failed to update their statuses and progress properly in the UI.
- **Desktop Remote File Downloads**: Resolved a bug in desktop mode where downloading files or folders from remote storage directly to the local PC filesystem failed to execute.

## [v0.2.9] - 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Context Menu Integration**: Added native context menu file manager integration support across Windows, Linux, and macOS. Allows users to register paths from the File Browser to right-click files/folders in the system file manager and upload them directly to a remote. #80 (Check the wiki: https://hakanismail.info/zarestia/rclone-manager/docs/integrations)
  - **Windows**: Creates a cascading "RClone Manager" right-click submenu ("Upload to [Remote]") and Send To folder shortcuts.
  - **Linux**: Installs GNOME Nautilus Python extensions, Nautilus fallback shell scripts, KDE Dolphin service menus, and Nemo actions.
  - **macOS**: Registers Finder Quick Actions (automator workflow services).
  - **CLI Commands**: Added `--send-to-remote` and `--send-to-path` command line arguments to trigger uploads directly from system context menus and custom scripts. Added strict argument validation to require a destination remote when `--send-to-path` is used, and at least one source file/folder when `--send-to-remote` is specified.
  - **Cleanup**: Automatically cleans up all custom integrations, registry entries, extensions, and shortcuts upon application uninstallation or manual path unregistration.
- **Operations Support**: Expanded Rclone operations support by adding `check`, `delete`, `copyurl`, `archivecreate`, and `cryptcheck`.
  - Added a new Action Selection Modal to choose and trigger these operations directly from the UI.
  - Implemented a dedicated Check Results Table in the transfer activity panel to view detailed logs (differences, missing files, errors) for `check` and `cryptcheck` tasks.
  - Integrated `cryptcheck` output parsing in the Rust backend to extract differences, missing source/destination files, and check errors.
- **Manual Obscure Support**: Added a built-in Obscure Tool utility in the remote config wizard to securely encrypt sensitive fields (passwords, tokens, keys) using Rclone's native obscure functionality. #237
  - Added an interactive UI panel to enter cleartext credentials, generate obscured values, and automatically apply them to targeted form controls or copy them to the clipboard.
- New background for dmg installer.
- **Librclone Support**: Added support for `librclone` (Beta testing feature for Android/iOS mobile targets). When `librclone` is enabled, application/rclone updates and local process management are disabled, while remote rclone instances and local servers remain supported.
  - **Android Build & Cross-Compilation**: Added NDK target toolchain cross-compiler mappings for all architectures (`aarch64`, `armv7`, `x86_64`, `386`) and created a GitHub Actions build workflow.
  - **DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) Resolver**: Overrode the default Go network resolver on Android to proxy DNS queries through HTTPS (port 443) to Cloudflare/Google, bypassing Android's port 53 raw socket restriction. (Refer to platform docs: `https://hakanismail.info/zarestia/rclone-manager/docs/platform/configuration-android.md`)
- **Deeplink support**: Added support for mobile custom URI scheme handler (`rclone-manager://oauth`) to automatically redirect and resume the application from web browsers during the OAuth process. (Needs Rclone 1.75 Beta and later.)

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Upgraded frontend to **Angular v22**, **TypeScript v6.0**, and **ngx-translate v18**.
  - Migrated the translation system from `TranslateModule` to a standalone, signal-driven `TranslatePipe`.
- **Tauri Backend**: Updated Rust cargo crate constraints (`tower-http`, `notify`), while pinning `sysinfo` and `keyring` for compatibility.
- Static flags updated. #242

### Fixed
- **Strict ESLint Compliance**: Resolved all strict lint errors (enforced `@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion` and `@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type` as errors). Removed all unsafe `!` assertions using optional chaining (`?.`), type-narrowed local variables, and nullish guards, and added explicit return type annotations to all methods, local helper closures, and factory functions.
- Fix the overloaded time for DirCacheTime: '1000h' to default rclone value.
- Fix the Rclone Flags modals not saves the numbers. Example: Transfers... #240
- Fix for path inputs in remote config wizard. Windows paths handled correctly now. #238

## [v0.2.8] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Language**: Added Ukrainian language support. (Thanks to @maksam07!) PR #230
- **CI/CD Validation**: Added a multi-OS GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) to automatically validate lints, formatting, and compilation checks across Linux, Windows, and macOS on push and pull request triggers. Rust code validating all linux, windows and macos platforms, frontend code validating is only linux platform.
- **PowerShell**: Added PowerShell 7+ (pwsh) support for mount plugin installer. If pwsh is not available on Windows, default to Windows PowerShell (powershell.exe). #229

### Changed
- **Updater Feature**: Gate the application and Rclone update system behind "updater" feature.
- Sync tab renamed to Operations tab.

### Fixed
- Detached dialog and other dialog fixes. #228
- Fixed silent update crash for windows.
- Fixed restart problem after apply update the application.

## [v0.2.7] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- **Predefined Performance Presets**: Added smart, OS-aware performance configuration presets automatically applied during initial remote creation (not triggered on edit or clone).
  - Integrates optimized VFS defaults (`CacheMode: 'full'`, large cache limits, directory caching) and backend buffer properties for high-performance cross-platform remote usage.
  - Automatically matches storage protocol families (e.g. S3-compatible, WebDAV) and host OS configurations (such as `NetworkMode` on Windows or `NoAppleXattr` on macOS).
- Local filesystem watchers for sync, copy, move, and bisync automations. Sync, copy, and move require at least one local source path; bisync watches local paths from both sides.
- Net-change debounce: create/delete pairs on the same path within the debounce window cancel each other out, suppressing temp files and atomic saves without explicit exclude rules.
- Added support for detached windows for dialogs (like progress, logs etc.). If you close the main window, dialogs will stay open. Some helper dialogs not open as a new window.
- Added a cancel support for While updates downloading. 
- **Rclone Version Validation**: Enhanced rclone binary validation to support minimum version enforcement and version parsing (including pre-releases). 
- French language added from Crowdin (https://crowdin.com/project/rclone-manger).

### Security
- **Secure-by-Default Local Engine Credentials**: Implemented a secure-by-default credential generation policy for the local Rclone engine. If no username or password is configured for a local backend, transient credentials are randomly generated in-memory at runtime. These transient credentials are never written to keyring and connections JSON. Every engine restart generates a fresh set of random credentials. Remote backends are unaffected.

### Changed
- Scheduled task manager and related components are changed to Automation manager. Releated language changed to Automation too. 
- **macOS Dock Visibility Control**: Added functionality to control the macOS dock visibility based on the presence of visible windows. The dock icon will now hide when there are no visible windows and show when there is at least one visible window. This is the default behavior for macOS apps that don't have a dock icon. This is a macOS-specific change. #208
- Profile setting changed into the default rclone RC values instead of parsing them to different values and after parsing them again rclone RC values. Settings auto migrated for old profiles. But if you have any special settings, you may need to reconfigure them. **Backup your settings before upgrading**!
- **Client-Side Preference Storage**: Migrated transient view preferences and viewport states (Nautilus layout/sizes/sorting, split divider position, navigation sidebar state, dashboard accordion states, and selected profiles/operations per remote) from the backend settings database to client-side local storage. These keys only for frontend and no need the backend to access them. Reduced the I/O operations.
- Remove the snap package support for now. Maybe will add it back in the future.

### Fixed
- Fixed missing language values on some sections of the application and remove the non-used language keys.
- Fixed the issue on wrong mapped rclone flags on backend and sync types.
- **Serve VFS Options**: Fixed VFS options being silently ignored on serve startup by dynamically flattening and mapping PascalCase VFS option keys to flat, CLI-style snake_case keys (e.g. `vfs_cache_mode`). This is a temporary backend workaround until upstream [rclone/rclone#9492](https://github.com/rclone/rclone/issues/9492) is resolved.


## [v0.2.6] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- Dry run toggle on Operation Control Panel for sync, bisync, copy and move operations.
- Added new component to map to cli rclone commands to application values.

### Changed
- Allow users the show hidden window via application shortcut. Not only via tray.

### Fixed
- **Rclone Flags Case Alignment**: On json editor, changed the flags format from camel case to pascal case to match with rclone struct format.
- Fixed the issue on destination paths not load correctly on remote config modal.
- UI not load the ordered remote list Fixed.
- Fixed the issue on when tray menu updated in main thread, UI thread was freezed for a long time. Not anymore.
- Some update issues fixed.

## [v0.2.5] - 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Snapcraft Support**: Added Snap package configuration for Linux systems. The application is now available via the Snap Store with classic confinement for full filesystem access.
- **Unified Command Registry**: Implemented a master command registry macro that automatically synchronizes Tauri IPC commands and headless HTTP endpoints. This simplifies adding new features and ensures parity between desktop and web modes.
- **Alert & Actions**: Added a new tab to the Alerts section for managing alert actions. Users can now define custom actions (OS Toast, Webhook, Script) that can be triggered when an alert rule matches.
- Download URL support for nautilus file browser. You can directly download file from url on selected path. Access via right vertical ellipsis menu on path bar.
- Add option to upload files or folder to right click context menu in nautilus file browser. Separate buttons for files and folder.
- **UI**: Implemented a Layout Editor for arranging and hiding dashboard and remote cards. Users can now customize their view by dragging cards to reorder them and using toggle buttons to hide unwanted items.
- **Shell Command Interpolation (Secure Macros)**: Path and option fields now support dynamic macro substitution using both backticks (`` `date` ``) and POSIX shell-style syntax (`$(date)`). Instead of insecure shell execution, the app now uses a safe, internal engine to expand macros like `date`, `hostname`, `user`, and `os`. The `date` macro supports full `strftime` formatting (e.g., `$(date +%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S)`), providing flexible and secure path generation across all platforms. Arbitrary shell command execution has been removed for security.
- Jottacloud provider added into the non-interactive remotes. 
- Nautilus drag-and-drop lasso selection. Hold left mouse button and drag to select multiple items.
- **Local Disk Identification**: Improved local disk identification and labeling. Fetches volume labels (Linux) and intelligently identifies user folders (Home, Downloads, etc.) across all platforms. **Note**: This feature relies on the `core/disks` command (introduced in Rclone v1.74) and requires an updated Rclone binary to function correctly.
- **Rclone Archive Integration**: Full support for `rclone archive` operations within the Nautilus file browser.
  - **Archive Creation**: Dedicated modal for creating archives with support for all Rclone-compatible formats (`zip`, `tar`, `tar.gz`, `tar.bz2`, `tar.xz`, `tar.zst`, `tar.br`, `tar.sz`, `tar.mz`, `tar.lz`, `tar.lz4`).
  - **Archive Listing**: Structured tabular view of archive contents with size, date, and folder/file icons.
  - **Archive Extraction**: One-click extraction support for remote and local archives.
- **Rclone Cat Fallback**: Implemented a robust fallback mechanism for file viewing. If direct filesystem access fails (due to permissions or platform limitations), the app now uses `rclone cat` via the RC API to retrieve content. Supports both `local-asset://` and headless `/stream` endpoints.
- While exporing the settings If backup encryption is enabled, show toggle for incluse the secret keys like rclone config passwords, or other secrets you've added.
- Implemented a offline page and PWA support for headless mode.
- Serve web template added (Beta). Needs some tweeks and polish.

### Changed
- **Unified Monitoring System**: Replaced multiple independent background monitors with a single, smarter polling system. The app now uses significantly fewer resources while providing faster and more responsive status updates.
  - System status, mount state, serve state, and engine health are now all checked in a single request instead of four separate ones.
  - Static information like rclone version and process ID is cached once at startup instead of being re-fetched continuously.
  - Polling speed automatically adapts: faster updates when jobs are running, slower when idle, and pauses when the app is hidden.
  - Job progress monitoring is also batched into fewer requests for better performance during transfers.
- Allow update support for remote rclone instances. Manual restart needed on remote rclone instance.
- change rclone binary location to direct binary path.
- Remove the batch upload limit from the Nautilus drag-and-drop feature (Headless mode only). App now upload the files on the temp folder of the remote instance after starting to upload to final destination. After the upload finishes, it will remove the files from the temp folder.
- Fixed the background management on flatpak. It will now use the D-Bus Background portal instead of the manual method. Reported Tauri bug: https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace/issues/3166

### Fixed
- **Audio Cover Support**: Enhanced audio cover extraction with support for FLAC and multiple other formats. Optimized image loading by moving to a native streaming architecture that allows browsers to decode images directly, improving both performance and memory usage across Desktop and Headless modes. Maybe future I can use this for tha thumbnail view of images and any other things too.
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: The file viewer now displays actual rclone error messages (e.g., "File is being used by another process") instead of a generic "Not Found" error, providing better diagnostic information to the user.
- **Drag and Drop**: Fix internal and external drag and drop problems in nautilus both windows and macOS.

## [v0.2.4] - 2026-04-14
### Added
- Detailed Remote Card variant added. Its can be enabled from layout editor.
- **Nautilus**: Added external OS drag-into-app file upload support. Users can now drag files and folders from their OS file manager directly into the Nautilus file browser. Folder structure is preserved with recursive directory creation. Supports both Tauri desktop and headless HTTP modes.
- **Tray**: Added "Open File Browser" menu item in tray. It will open the file browser in a new window.
- **Language**: Added Simplified Chinese language support. (Thanks to @why25!)
- **Nautilus**: Added "spring-loaded folder" behavior. Dragging an item and hovering over a folder, breadcrumb, tab, or sidebar item for 1sec will automatically open/navigate to it.
- Readd the Json Editor for rclone fields. (Now it is optional with toggle button. Not like before v0.1.5). This one more user friendly. Now you can add or edit the custom flags from there too.
- Legacy config directories for docker users.
- **Core**: Added support for generic Rclone Environment Variables. Users can now specify arbitrary environment variables (e.g., `RCLONE_NO_UPDATE_MODTIME=true`) directly in the UI. This provides a flexible solution for FUSE compatibility and other rclone-specific configurations.
 - **Remote Config**: Show direct OAuth URL in remote creation/editing flows with a compact copy button; preserve the OAuth helper URL during remote configuration so users can open or copy the link.
- **Security**: Added support for `RCLONE_MANAGER_SECRET`, `RCLONE_MANAGER_SECRET_PATH`, and `RCLONE_MANAGER_SECRET_FILE` environment variables for managing `rcman` encrypted credentials. These serve as fallbacks when the OS keyring is unavailable or malfunctioning. If no secret is provided via environment variables and the keyring is inaccessible, credentials will be stored in-memory and lost upon application restart.
- **Job Detail**: Introduced a job detail view modal, allowing users to inspect granular operation details directly by selecting a job from the list in the General tab.
- **Settings**: Added `max_upload_batch_size` setting to the General tab. This setting controls the maximum size of a batch of files uploaded from the local computer in a single request. Only available on headless mode.
- **Translation**: Added missing rclone provider translations.

### Changed
- **Nautilus**: Replaced Angular CDK drag-and-drop with native HTML5 Drag and Drop API for file and folder operations. This provides a more responsive, system-native feel. (Note: CDK remains active for tab reordering).
- **Nautilus**: Improved split view drag UX. The active pane now automatically switches when hovering over the other panel during a drag operation.
- Small design changes across the app.
- Package-manager builds (Flatpak, deb, rpm, Arch, portable, container) no longer hide the Updates tab. The app still checks for new versions and notifies you.
- **Nautilus**: Nautilus file browser now supports multiple windows. You can open multiple Nautilus windows for different remotes or paths. Each window is independent and has its own state but they share the same app instance and configuration. You can open a new Nautilus window from the tray menu, right-clicking a folder or remote to open on new window, or dragging a tab to the desktop to open it in a new window.

### Fixed
- **Nautilus**: Prevented invalid drag-and-drop operations, such as dropping a file into its current directory or dropping a folder onto itself.
- **Nautilus**: Prevented spring-opening a folder that is currently being dragged.
- **Tray**: Fully feature-gated tray implementation; `tray` code is excluded. Preventing tray-related imports/logic in Docker builds where tray is not needed.
- Buggy and non-performant AppImage release files are fixed. Now they works properly on all Linux distributions.
- **Mount**: Fixed a bug that prevented mounting multiple profiles or instances of the same remote at different mount points.
- **Serve**: Fixed a UI issue where the listening address appeared as "undefined" for default profiles.
- **Core**: Removed restrictive duplicate checks in mount and serve operations to allow running multiple instances with unique configurations (e.g., different profiles or ports).
- **File Viewer**: Fixed the download functionality in headless web mode by implementing browser-native downloads. Remote files can now be downloaded to the local computer in both desktop and web environments.
- **Core**: Bunch of scheduler tasks fixes.
- **Core**: Fixed the issue where the app was not able to update rclone and app on headless mode.
- **FileSystem**: Fixed a bug in headless mode where selecting a local directory or file would return a relative path instead of an absolute one.

### Know Issues
- Tauri asset protocols has a bug that causes media streaming to not work properly on linux webview2gtk. So this mean videos and music files not gonna work on linux systems. But it works on headless systems. Track https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/3725 for updates on this issue. 


## [v0.2.3] - 2026-03-17

### Warning
- On v0.2.2 release we added the `obscure` argument to the rclone remote generation process. This means that the passwords and api keys will be encrypted in the rclone config file. If you have remotes like `crypt` or similar to required keys, you need to re-create or update them. Otherwise keys will not be encrypted. (#90)

### Added
- Windows version of headless builds now available.
- Homebrew tap for macOS added.
- Restrict the 'sensitive' datas which mapped by rclone.
- Runtime Remote profile settings added. Now you can set the remote specific settings on runtime instead of the change it from the config file. It will be applied to runtime and does not change the rclone config file. You can set it from the remote details view. Note THAT! These settings saved the normal remote settings. So these are not saved on the keyring or encrypted like rclone config passwords or auth password setting on the Backend Management Dialog. So be careful when you set these settings.

### Changed
- Custom date time picker replaced with the native date time picker on angular material.
- Dependencies updated due to security vulnerabilities.

### Fixed
- App UI now update properly after values changed.
- RPM dependencies fixed.
- CLI `tray` argument fixed.

## [v0.2.2] - 2026-03-11

### Warning
- While this in this release we added the `obscure` argument to the rclone remote generation process. This means that the passwords and api keys will be encrypted in the rclone config file. If you have remotes like `crypt` or similar to required keys, you need to re-create or update them. Otherwise keys will not be encrypted. (#90)

### Added
- **Language**: Added Spanish language support. (Thanks to @dikler!)
- **Tray**: Added visual task indicator to system tray icon when transfers are active. (Resolves #61).
- **CLI**: Added `--data-dir`, `--cache-dir`, and `--logs-dir` flags for custom directory overrides.
- **Docker**: Added `RCLONE_MANAGER_DATA_DIR`, `RCLONE_MANAGER_CACHE_DIR`, and `RCLONE_MANAGER_LOG_DIR` environment variables for native path overrides.
- **Paths**: Implemented platform-native log directory resolution (Cache directory on Linux/Windows, Logs directory on macOS).
- Nautilus Component: Allow the edit text based files. Using rclone rc operations/uploadfile to save.
- Nautilus Component: Added delete, move and copy operations support.
- Nautilus Component: Added vertical split mode support.
- Nautilus Component: Added cover image display support for audio files.
- Some cloud providers icons added to the app.

### Changed
- **Core**: Replaced Tauri's integrated protocols with custom OS-aware protocol schemas (`http://rclone.localhost` / `http://local-asset.localhost` for Windows WebView2, and `rclone://` / `local-asset://` for Unix WebKit) to fix media streaming display bugs.
- **CLI**: Structurally reorganized command-line arguments into `GeneralArgs` and `HeadlessArgs` for better maintainability and build-mode awareness.
- **Build**: Optimized headless build by strictly feature-gating desktop-only plugins (`dialog`, `shell`, `window-state`).
- **Tray**: Optimized performance of tray unmount and browse actions by eliminating global config lookups.
- **Docker**: Rclone binary no longer bundled in the image. Downloaded at first startup to a persistent volume.
- **Docker**: Added `PUID` and `PGID` environment variable support for user/group mapping.
- **Docker**: Entrypoint extracted to standalone `entrypoint.sh` with `gosu` privilege dropping.
- **Docker**: Simplified volume layout (`/data` and `/config`).
- **Environment**: Use Zoneless Change Detection and CodeMirror instead of Syntax Highlighting.

### Fixed
- Fixed bug where remotes requiring sensitive fields like passwords or API keys (e.g., Filen) failed to create via UI due to being sent in plain text instead of an obscured format to the rclone RC API. (Fixed #128)
- Sensitive fields are now accept the paste. (Fixed #129)
- Blury icons fixed. Icon provider change to Google Material Icons.
- Reorder tauri plugins (Cause of startup crash).
- Remove the global shortcut handler from tauri. (Fixed #117)
- Fixed directory size calculation in the File Viewer returning the disk root size instead of the selected subfolder size.
- Fixed shifted icons across the app.

## [v0.2.1] - 2026-02-05

### Added
- **Job Group Management**: Jobs are now automatically organized by remote name and profile name (e.g., all sync operations for "gdrive" with "default" profile are grouped together named "sync/Google Drive/default"). This makes it easier to:
  - View stats per remote instead of all mixed together  
  - Stop all running jobs for a specific remote at once
  - Track and manage operations on a per-remote basis
- rclone rc core/du added. When remote mounted its gonna show inside the `Mount Control` accordion. Its calculate the disk usage from local mount point.
- Added more notifications.
- Added new nautilus icons from Morewaita icon theme. Repo: https://github.com/somepaulo/MoreWaita

### Changed
- When memory optimization is enabled, app only reopen fron tray icon. Not from the desktop entry or shortcuts (Including command line).

### Fixed
- When update the rclone , app now checking the preconfigured path is writable or not. If not, app will use the default config path.
- Fixed the containerized version for path handling.
- Other small fixes and improvements.

## [v0.2.0] - 2026-02-02

### Added
- **Settings Management Library (rcman)**: Extracted and refactored the internal settings management system into a standalone, reusable Rust library called [rcman](https://github.com/Zarestia-Dev/rcman). This provides schema-based configuration, backup/restore, secret storage, and a derive macro for automatic schema generation. The app now uses rcman as an external dependency.
- Nautilus Component: Added dot and other text files preview support. Now you can preview the content of dot and other text files.
- Nautilus Component: Added markdown preview support. Now you can preview the content of markdown files.
- Nautilus Component: Added code highlight support. Now you can preview the content of code files with syntax highlighting.
- Nautilus Component: Added bulk hash calculation support. Now you can calculate the hash of multiple files inside a directory.
- Multiple backend support added. Now you can connect multiple and remote rclone instances via a single app. Remote config unlock supported (via rc config/unlock). Path change support added to (via rc config/setpath).
- Multiple profile support added for backends. Every backend has a own remote settings profile. Also supported the export and import.
- Multiple language support added. Now you can change the language of the app. Needs community help for translations.
- Log file support added (both app and rclone logs). You can manage the log settings from configuration modal (Log file location cannot be changed on rclone. I think rclone has problem on that. Rclone version 1.72.1 :/).
- Modals now transforms to bottom sheet on mobile devices. Like how it works on gnome. Basic SCSS trick but looks more native.
- Window state persistence support added. Now the app remembers the window size on close and restores it on next launch.
- Added support for additional rclone flags. Users can now configure and pass custom flags to rclone commands through the settings. Some rclone flags are reserved and cannot be used (App prevent these flags to use in the settings). 
- Rclone garbage collector added. You can run the garbage collector from the About Modal -> About Rclone -> Memory.
- Rclone cache cleaner added (Remote backend caches). You can run the cache cleaner from the About Modal -> About Rclone -> Backend Cache. App also automatically cleans the cache when remote updated or deleted.
 


### Changed
- Removed legacy integrated settings manager in favor of the new rcman library
- Mount plugin detector and installer improved. Dynamic checks for the latest plugin version for installation.
- Terminal remote support removed. App can handle the all remote operations.
- UI simplified and modernized.
- Allow tray icon on headless mode to.
- Headless mode improvements.

### Fixed
- Broken theme setting fixed. Now it correctly applies the theme.
- On headless mode cannot open the local files (Access denied error). Now it fixed.

## [v0.1.9] - 2025-12-20

### Warning
- Since multiple profiles support, the old profiles are automatically migrated to the new profile system. But before the update, please backup your old profiles. If there is a any problem with the new profile system, you can restore your old profiles from the backup and app try the re-migration to the new profile system.

### Added
- Multiple profiles support added for all operations (Sync, Copy, Move, Bisync, Mount, Serve). Now you can create multiple profiles for each operation and run them separately. Also operation UI has been changed to show profiles. User can configure it from the detailed remote setup modal. User also can select the shared settings and also add a multiple profiles for shared settings to. Quick Remote Access only works with default profile (When you start a action, it uses the default profile).
- Added special Flatpak autostart entry for Flatpak version. Now it creates a desktop entry for Flatpak version of the app. This entry is not handled by Tauri. (Fixed #63)
- Nautilus Component: Added hash calculation support for files. Now you can calculate the hash of a file and copy it to clipboard on the properties dialog.
- Nautilus Component: Added public link generation support for files and directories. If remote supports public link generation, it will be available in the properties dialog.
- Nautilus Component: Enabled download button for remote files. Now you can download remote files to your local machine.
- Debugging page added on `About Modal`. Click the app logo 5 times in 2 seconds to open the debugging page.

### Changed
- On linux remove the rclone to required dependencies when installing via deb or rpm packages. Because app handle the rclone binary installation and update itself correctly.  
- Encrypted export not required standalone 7zip binary anymore. Changed to sevenz-rust crate. Not break the old encrypted exports.
- On tray icon when remote not mounted, it shows the Browse (In App). Basically it opens the RClone Manager's `Nautilus` with that remote.
- Angular and Angular Material updated to v21 and other dependencies updated to latest stable versions.

### Fixed
- Remote configuration step provider selection fixed. Now it correctly filters the provider-specific fields when Provider selected. (issue #59 and #1)
- Broken reduce animations fixed. (issue #60)
- Links openning in the about modal fixed. Now it opens the links in the default browser.

## [v0.1.8] - 2025-11-06
### Added
- Developer Setting: Memory Optimization (Destroy Window on Close). Added a new experimental option in Developer Settings that destroys the main window instead of hiding it when closed. This significantly reduces background RAM usage. On Linux, this also actively cleans up lingering WebKit "zombie" processes to prevent memory leaks over long sessions. On MacOS, this not so effective because MacOS version dont use a lot of memory for background processes. But its useful linux and windows.
- Nautius file manager component added for file browsing. This new file manager component provides a more native and integrated file browsing experience within the app, leveraging Nautilus' capabilities. Currently, it is not supports all features like copy, move, delete, etc. They will be added in future updates. Also support the preview for images, text files and pdf files.
- `marked` dependency added for markdown rendering in the About modal. This allows us to display formatted release notes fetched from GitHub in a user-friendly manner.
- Support for local path navigation on the remote config. User can now navigate to local paths when configuring remotes that use local file systems.
- Added Flatpak detection and warning banner. If the app is running as a Flatpak, a warning banner will be displayed to inform the user about permission limitations. The banner can be dismissed and will not show again once dismissed.
- VFS Control Panel added to mount and serve pages. Now you can manage VFS instances directly from the app. You can view the status of VFS instances, control their behavior and monitor their queues.

### Changed
- Charts removed from sync, copy, move and bisync activity panels. Also chartjs dependency removed from the project to reduce the bundle size.
- Remote Logs Modal design and functionality improvements.
- Export Modal design and functionality improvements.
- Dashboard General Overview panel design and functionality improvements. Now it supports layout customization.

## [v0.1.7] - 2025-11-14
### Added
- Added schedule support for sync, copy, move, and bisync operations. You can now schedule these operations to run at specific times or intervals using a cron-like syntax. You can find the scheduling options in the remote sync operation settings. (Supports detailed cron expressions. Example `15,45 8-18/2 * 1,11 1-5`: Every 2 hours at minutes 15 and 45 between 8 AM and 6 PM on Mondays and Fridays in January and November)
- New time picker module added for better clock time selection.
- Rclone Serve support added. You can now start and stop rclone serve commands. The serve status is displayed in the sidebar for easy access. You can find the serve options in the Serve Tab. Serve configurations (vfs, backend and filter) separated from the other configurations.

### Changed

### Changed
- Optimized the **Preferences Modal** with improved settings management, enhanced form handling, and a new reset-to-defaults function.
- Refactored the **Dashboard** and **Security Settings** components for improved code structure and readability, including minor UI enhancements.
- Enhanced the **Repair Sheet**: The password repair step now also allows you to change the `rclone.conf` file path, giving you more control during recovery.

### Fixed
- Fixed a critical bug where job-specific settings (like `mount` parameters or `bisync` filters) were not being saved or applied correctly.
- Resolved several issues in the remote editing modal, including bugs related to path parsing and cloning remotes.
- Fixed an issue where the `rclone.conf` file would remain locked after setting or changing the config password. The app now handles this automatically without requiring an engine restart.

## [v0.1.5] - 2025-10-30
### Added
- Added a Backend Settings modal. You can now set the backend options globally for all remotes. If you wants to override the backend options for a specific remote, you can do it in the remote settings. (e.g. mount options, vfs options, etc.). Also added the export and import feature for the backend settings on export modal.
- New Backend flag support for remotes. You can now set backend flags for remotes in the remote settings. This will be applied to all operations for that remote.
- Added Filter options support for mounts. You can now set filter options for mounts in the remote settings. This will be applied to the mount operation for that remote.
- Added system theme detection support. You can now set the theme to system in the settings. It will automatically change the theme based on the system theme.

### Changed
- Password Manager modal has been removed. Now the password manager is integrated into the Backend Settings modal. You can manage your passwords in the Backend Settings modal.
- Some npm and cargo dependencies have been updated to their latest versions.
- Detailed Remote Modal UI and behavior has been improved for better user experience and usability. Also its now filters the displayed fields based on the provider type of the remote (e.g., S3 specific fields for AWS or Alibaba Cloud providers not show the all provider fields anymore. Only relevant fields are displayed).
- Removed the json editor for remote adding and editing. Now only the form-based configuration is available for better user experience and usability.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where the RClone Manager Logo was not displayed correctly in the app.
- When one modal opens, disable the open other modals via shortcuts or other ways (Unlimited modal opening). This include the Onboard state too. (This not include the dialog modals like delete confirmation, etc.)
- Strip `RulesOpt.` prefix from rule fields before sending to rclone (e.g. `RulesOpt.ExcludeFrom` -> `ExcludeFrom`), which fixes issues where rclone ignored prefixed field names.
- Fixed an issue where the remotes not showing correctly in the tray menu.
- Fixed terminal window flash on Windows (brief terminal/console window appearing) when starting the app or running rclone operations.



## [0.1.4] - 2025-10-13
### Added
- Added a rclone beta update checker support. It will check for the latest beta version of rclone and notify the user if a new beta version is available. (Default Stable channel is selected. You can change it in the About modal > About Rclone section.)

### Changed
- Removed the rclone update modal and update badge. Now the update status is shown in the About modal > About Rclone section.

### Fixed
- Fixed a crash on Linux systems without NetworkManager by adding graceful error handling for metered network checks.


## [0.1.3-beta] - 2025-09-30
### Warning
- In this version, app identifier has been changed from `com.rclone-manager.app` to `com.rclone.manager` because of potential conflicts with MacOS application bundle extension. If you are updating from a previous version, please uninstall the old version first to avoid any conflicts. This change is necessary to ensure proper functionality and avoid issues with application recognition on MacOS. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding. You can export your configuration via the export feature before uninstalling the old version.

### Added
- **Auto-update support** using Tauri's built-in updater plugin. The application can now check for updates and install them with user permission. Additionally, users can install a previous version if it appears in the update section—this is typically offered as a fallback if a newer version has issues. Also with the new update system, bug fixes and improvements can be delivered more frequently (You're not waiting a 3 months anymore :D).

- Support for ARM architecture (Linux and Windows). The application can now run on ARM-based systems, such as Raspberry Pi and ARM-based Windows devices.

- Native console support for the native terminal. You can now open the remote configuration in the native terminal by clicking the "Remote Terminal" button in the top left add button. It will use the preferred terminal app from the settings. Also, you can set the preferred terminal app in the settings.

- **Encrypted configuration file support**: Added comprehensive support for rclone encrypted configuration files.
  - Automatic detection of encrypted config files
  - Secure password storage using system keyring/credential store
  - Encrypt/decrypt configuration operations

- Implemented the `bisync` and `move` operations for remotes.
  - Bisync: This operation synchronizes two remotes in both directions, ensuring that changes made in either remote are reflected in the other.
  - Move: This operation moves files from one remote to another, effectively transferring data without leaving duplicates.
- Added other configs for operations. (e.g. mountType, createEmptySrcDirs etc.)
- Added the `mountType` option for the mount type selection. It can be set to `mount`, `mount2`, or `NfsMount`. This types comes from the Rclone API. Default is `mount` (API handle this automatically).

- Added primary action selection - choose up to 3 preferred actions (mount/sync/copy/etc.) per remote for quick access and overview visibility. You can select and deselect actions in the remote general details view. This also affects the tray menu.

- Added interactive config support to Detailed Remote Modal. So we can make the post remote configuration. (Like Microsoft OneDrive)

### Changed
- Updated the Angular version to the latest stable version. Version 20.3.0

### Need Fix
- After engine restart, need the apply the startup settings again. (e.g. config file path, bw limit, etc.) (All Fixed)
- Remote updates not working properly. When you update a some settings to default, it does not update the remote. I know whats the problem. (Fixed)

## [beta-0.1.2] - 2025-07-15
### Added
- General tab added.
- Remote Clone feature added. Under the remote detail ellipsis button (Clones a remote with settings to new remote.).
- Rclone pid watcher feature added with instant stop Rclone process functionality. Also listens for changes in the rclone process state and updates the UI accordingly. You can find it in `About RClone Manager > About Rclone`  (I see the core/pid rcd command and I want to make something for it. IDK why but I did it.)
- Detecting the metered connection and showing a warning banner (Linux needed Network Manager. Its `nmcli` command is used to check for metered connections). Not supported on macOS because it does not support metered network detection (For now, it is only show the warning banner.).
- Watcher for mounted remotes added. It will automatically unmount the remote if it is not mounted anymore. It will also update the UI accordingly (5 seconds interval). You can also force check the mounted remotes by this Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + M.
- Linting and formatting scripts added for the frontend and backend. It uses ESLint, Prettier, Clippy, and Rustfmt.
- Rclone update check feature added. It will check for the latest version of Rclone. Under the `About RClone Manager > About Rclone` section, you can find the update status and the update button.
- Rclone binary location selection feature added. You can select the Rclone binary location in the settings, onboard and the repair sheet. It will be used for the Rclone operations. If you don't select it, it will use the default location.

### Changed
- UI design has been improved.
- Mount path selection not forced to select a path from the file browser anymore. You can also type the path manually but it will be validated. Also added support for AllowNonEmpty option in the mount step. This allows you to mount a remote to a non-empty folder if its true.
- Onboarding process has been improved.
- Frontend and backend services have been refactored to use a more modular approach.
